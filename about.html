        <h2>who created tomcat curiosities?</h2>
        <div id=sophiaDes>
        <p>the founder and artisan behind tomcat curiosities is sophia reck. <br> <br>
          sophia is a macabre enthusiast and undergraduate student at new york university.
        although she loves the city, she was raised in a small town in berks county,
        pennsylvania. growing up, sophia had a three-acre backyard where she helped to raise the
        irish wolfhounds her family bred. being raised in this enviornment exposed sophia to a lot
        of wildlife—including the death of that wildlife— from a young age.<br><br>
        sophia wholeheartedly believes that embracing death, rather than ignoring and fearing it,
        is an important mindset. she hopes that you can also begin to find beauty in the
        aftermath of the inevitable.<br><br> if you're interested in seeing sophia's
        more conventional design work, her portfolio can be found at

        <h2>where does tomcat curiosities get its animal bones?</h2>
        <h4><i>WARNING: the following content may be disturbing to some readers.
          reader discretion is advised.</i></h4>
          <p><br><br>all animal bones used in the creation of tomcat curiosities
            jewlery are procured from animals that have already perished. our founder,
            sophia, personally scavenges for animal remains; the majority of which
            are found on the side of the road after being hit by cars. <br><br>
            after an animal is found, the bones are carefully dissected out by hand.
            any remaining organic matter is removed in a natural water maceration,
            which is an accelrated anaerobic rotting process. Then, the bones are soaked
            in a heated soapy water bath. finally, the bones are whitened and sterilized
            in a hydrogen peroxide bath. this entire process takes an average of 3-6 weeks,
          but may take longer depending on the specimen. <br><br>after cleaning the bones,
          they are sorted and stored until used for jewlery.</p>
