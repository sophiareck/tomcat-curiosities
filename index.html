    <p> often times, people see death as the end of one's existence.
       on the contrary, death is simply another aspect of life.
       without the end, there can be no more new beginnings for
       myriad reasons. much of life even depends on death:
      fForests rely on nutrients released by the soil-dwelling
        organisms that consume decaying matter; animals rely on
        forests for food and shelter. it all is a part of nature.</p>
